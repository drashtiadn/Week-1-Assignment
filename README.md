# Python Basics
Objective: 
The purpose of this assignment is to test  understanding of Python basics, including syntax, data structures, and basic functions. 

Exercise 1: Variables and Data Types
1. Declare variables of different data types (integer, float, string, and Boolean).
2. Perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on numerical variables.
3. Concatenate two or more string variables.
4. Perform a comparison operation (e.g., equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than) on numerical variables and store the result in a Boolean variable.

Exercise 2: Lists
1. Create a list containing at least five elements of mixed data types.
2. Append a new element to the list.
3. Update the value of an existing element in the list.
4. Remove an element from the list.
5. Access a specific element or a range of elements in the list.

Exercise 3: Dictionaries
1. Create a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs.
2. Add a new key-value pair to the dictionary or list.
3. Update the value associated with a key in the dictionary or list.
4. Remove a key-value pair from the dictionary or list.
5. Access the value associated with a specific key in the dictionary or list.

Exercise 4: Conditional Statements
1. Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero. The number can be hardcoded or taken as input from the user (optional).

Exercise 5: Loops
1. Write a program that prints the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
2. Write a program that calculates the factorial of a number (n) using a loop. The number n can be hardcoded or taken as input from the user (optional).

Exercise 6: Functions
1. Define a function that accepts two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.
2. Define a function that accepts a list of numbers as input and returns the average of the numbers.
3. Call the functions defined above with appropriate inputs and display the results.
