# Exercise 1: Variables and Data Types

# 1: Declare variables of different data types

#Integer
age = 12   

#Float
temperature = 67.54

#String
name = "Alex"

#Boolean
is_raining = True

print(age)          #Print Interger
print(temperature)  #Print Float
print(name)         #Print String
print(is_raining)   #Print Boolean


# 2: Arithmetic Operations

# Define the numercial variables
a = 24
b = 12
print("a = ",a)
print("b = ",b)

# Addition
c = a + b
print("Addition = ",c)

# Subtraction
c = a - b
print("Subtraction = ",c)

# Multiplication
c = a * b
print("Multiplication = ",c)

# Division
c = a / b
print("Division = ",c)


# 3: Concatenate two or more string variables.

# Define three string variables
first_name = "Alex"
middle_name = "Phil"
last_name = "Dunphy"

# Concatenate the three variables
full_name = first_name + " "+ middle_name + " "+ last_name

# Print the result
print("Full Name: ",full_name)


# 4: Comparison Operation

# Define the numercial variables
num_1 = 23
num_2 = 86

# Equal to
num = num_1 == num_2    
print("Equal to: ",num)

# Not Equal to
num = num_1 != num_2
print("Not Equal to: ",num)

# Greater than
num = num_1 > num_2
print("Greater than: ",num)

# Less than
num = num_1 < num_2
print("Less than",num)
